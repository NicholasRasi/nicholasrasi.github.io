Filterss was developed for the DIMA (Design and Implementation of Mobile Applications) course at Polimi.

It is an **Android** native application used to read content from RSS feeds with filtering, rating features, online / offline working mode, ecc (more info on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.makebit.filterss){:target="_blank"}).

It is open source and available [here](https://github.com/makebit/FilterssApp){:target="_blank"}.

### Why Filterss
The application we've built comes from the need to read news online in a simple and effective way. In particular, we believe that being able to filter quality and interesting content among the high number of articles published every day online, is a common problem nowadays.


### Implementation
- The backend API was developed using **ExpressJS** and hosted on a VPS
- The application is developed in **Java**

Moreover, I created the app icon, app design, showcase video (all visible on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.makebit.filterss){:target="_blank"}).
