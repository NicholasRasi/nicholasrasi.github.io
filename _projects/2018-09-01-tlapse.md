TLapse is a self-built portable instrument for recording timelapse in motion (hyperlapse) on the pan axis. It is suitable for action cameras such as GoPro, Yi, etc.


### Why TLapse
There are different tools for shooting 360 [Hyperlapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlapse){:target="_blank"}. However, the simplest ones, are just timers with a mount, thus the rotation speed, duration, and interval between shot are not configurable. There are other, more complex 360 hyperlapse machine but they are very expensive.

This project aims to build a 360 Hyperlapse on a budget, using cheap components and a 3D printed case.

The firmware and 3D model are available on this [repository](https://github.com/NicholasRasi/TLapse){:target="_blank"}.
