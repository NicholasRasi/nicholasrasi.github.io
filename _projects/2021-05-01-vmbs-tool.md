### Cloud QoS?
This project aims to study the performance of VMs offered by cloud providers. In particular we are interested in the performance variability over time.

### A Quick Overview
I worked on all the components of VMBS: the infrastructure configuration, the execution of the benchmarks, the data parsing and cleaning, the data analysis.

All the details are available on the [repository](https://github.com/NicholasRasi/VMBS-tool){:target="_blank"}.

### Results
A in-depth discussion about the obtained results has been written in a scientific paper that is currently under review.

The resulting graphs are available on the [Visualizer](https://nicholasrasi.github.io/VMBS-tool-Analyzer/data_visualizer/index.html){:target="_blank"}.
