## Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Nicholas Rasi

#### Just a brief recap...

I graduated in Computer Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Milano with the MsC thesis *TensorFlow Microservices with Quality of Service Guarantees*.

After the graduation, I had the great opportunity to work at Polimi, as a research assistant (DEIB department), on a project about the design, implementation and maintenance of microservices applications.

During the research activity I studied, designed and created prototypes for the development, management and execution of complex and adaptive software systems, created as microservices. The research activity allowed me to learn and test different technologies.

I contributed to the writing of scientific articles, which allowed me to improve my communication skills and scientific method. At the same time, I have developed websites and web applications for various clients and created open source [projects](/projects).

> My main areas of interest are microservices, serverless, software architectures, containers and orchestrators, cloud automation and IaaC. However, I like to study and experiment with new technologies 

#### Moreover...
I'm keen on [video making](https://rhvideo.it/){:target="_blank"} and [screen printing on organic tshirts](http://www.respectshirts.it/){:target="_blank"}. In my spare time I like to [read books and articles](/reading-list) (especially non-fiction ones, about self-development).
