## Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Nicholas Rasi

### Just a brief recap...

I graduated in Computer Science and Engineering at Polytechnic University of Milan (PoliMI) with my MS thesis *TensorFlow Microservices with Quality of Service Guarantees*.

After the graduation, I had the great opportunity to work at PoliMI, as a research assistant (DEIB department), on a project about the design, implementation and maintenance of microservices applications. At the same time, I have developed websites and web applications for several clients and created open source projects.
My projects are visible on the [projects](/projects) page.

> My main areas of interest are microservices, serverless, software architectures, containers and orchestrators, cloud automation and IaaC. However, I like to study and experiment with new technologies 

## Core Skills
- University level experience in many topics (software engineering, distributed systems, artificial intelligence, IoT, principles of programming languages, middleware technologies for distributed systems, mobile applications, computer security)
- Experienced in multiple programming languages (Python, JavaScript, Java)
- Knowledge of cloud engineering tools (Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, Linux, GIT)
- I am flexible and versatile, I like multi-disciplinary approaches
- I work well remotely and am highly self-motivated
- I like to work in a team

## Work Experiences
### Research Assistant at Polytechnic University of Milan (DEIB department)
During the research activity I have been involved on various projects. In particular, I studied, designed and created prototypes for the development, management and execution of complex and adaptive software systems, created as 
This experience allowed me to learn and test different technologies. I contributed, together with my colleagues, to the writing and revision of scientific papers. This allowed me to improve my communication skills, acquire rigor and scientific method. During this experience I worked 100% remotely. 
In particular, I worked on:
- Machine learning inference with heterogeneous hardware
- Benchmark of cloud virtual machines performances and variability
- Containers
- Federated learning

**Used tools**: Kubernetes, Docker, Container, Ansible, Terraform, Cloud Provider, GIT, Bash, TensorFlow, Slurm, Pandas, Plotly.

### Web Developer
I have been involved in the design, development and management of websites, e-commerce, web applications for various clients. Here are some collaborations: contractnetwork.it, lememoire.it, vernisse.it, aroundwater.it, guestmagazine.it, lorenzonoe.com, sdgwedding.it, adven.it, hotelmag.it. During the period 2011-2014 I worked at Vagamondo (Verbania) as an IT systems technician, for hardware maintenance, for the development and management of the site and the design of advertising.

**Used tools**: HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, WordPress, MySQL, Shopify, ExpressJS, React, PHP, Photoshop.

### Moreover...
I'm keen on [video making](https://rhvideo.it/){:target="_blank"} and [screen printing on organic tshirts](http://www.respectshirts.it/){:target="_blank"}. In my spare time I like to [read books and articles](/reading-list) (especially non-fiction ones, about self-development).
